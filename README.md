This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with AsyncStorage in React Native: attempting to access data before it's fully retrieved.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version using async/await for improved asynchronous handling.  The error typically manifests as undefined or null values being retrieved because the asynchronous operation hasn't finished when the data is accessed.
